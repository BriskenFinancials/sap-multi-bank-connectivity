### **Detailed Project Description**

#### **Project Title**
**Productized Implementation of SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity (MBC)**

#### **Project Overview**
This project offers a **fixed-scope, fixed-price solution** for implementing **SAP Multi-Bank Connectivity (MBC)** using Brisken's productized methodology.
